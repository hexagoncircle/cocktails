# Cocktails

This goal of this project was to create a quick prototype that is inspired by the following photo. Using HTML (Pug), CSS (SCSS), and Javascript, I built what is essentially a cocktail maker. Hey, cheers!

## How's it work?

The current iteration of this project gives you three drinks to choose from. When a drink is selected, the cocktail data is fetched from a `drinks` object containing all of the components that make up the cocktail (name, ingredients, garnishes, glass type, and more). The ingredients of the cocktail will be "poured" into the glass one by one. *Recommended:* make one of these cocktails at home and enjoy it while enjoying this project.

## Todo
